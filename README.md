📝 NucleOS – A Lightweight Pseudo-Bare-Metal Operating System for ESP32

NucleOS is a minimal, low-footprint operating system built from the ground up for ESP32 modules. Designed with a pseudo-bare-metal architecture, it gives you near-total control over the hardware without the overhead of FreeRTOS — making it ideal for embedded systems, educational projects, and custom firmware development.
